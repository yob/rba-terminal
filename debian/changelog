rbaterminal (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * improve rbadesktop wrapper to retry connections after a failure
  * depend on rdesktop > 1.6.0
    * 1.6.0 is the current stable release, we need the exit code patch
      that is in trunk. Hopefully 1.7 is released soon.
    * in the meantime, I've built a "1.6.1" debian package that
      includes the patch
